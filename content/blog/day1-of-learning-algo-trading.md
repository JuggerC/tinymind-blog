Recently, I have been participating in a trading competition called Prosperity3, which is organized by IMC.
However, since I have only learned programming for less than half a month, I am not confident enough to compete with others using my code. Therefore, I used Vibe Code. I asked Claude to code for my algorithmic trading. But the level of my vibe coding skills is not yet mature. It turned out to be a flat result, earning almost no tokens. So, I just quit the algorithmic trading section.

I will update my learning on algorithmic trading in this repository, using the book Successful Algorithm Trading from quantstart.com.
